# Name: Frontend E-Commerce Demonstration

## 🌟 Overview

This project is a dynamic, single-page application (SPA) that simulates the user experience of a modern e-commerce platform. It features core functionalities like product browsing, cart management, and a full checkout process, all utilizing **client-side mock data**.

This serves as a strong demonstration of building complex user interfaces, managing global state, and handling application routing within a purely frontend environment.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Architecture

### Frontend (Client)
* **Framework:** **React.js**
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**
* **State Management:** **React Context API**
* **Routing:** **React Router DOM**


### Backend (Server/API)
* **NONE:** This application is intentionally decoupled from a backend and does not require a database or server to run.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Product Catalog:** Browse products using data imported from a local JSON/JS file.
* **Shopping Cart:** Add, remove, and update quantities of items in the cart (managed via [State Management Tool]).
* **User Flow Simulation:** Simulated user registration/login and a full mock checkout process.
* **[Payment/Order Confirmation]:** The checkout process successfully transitions to an Order Confirmation screen without connecting to a payment gateway.
* **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
